# GLMarketplace - React Assigment

## (Lack of) Implementation

The major missing features is the Medal with the button 
and the implementation of the other device-versions. 


## Time Spent

I've approximately spent 12 hours on this assingment - Given my time spend on exams 
and my underestamation of the difficulty of this assigment, I'd propbably have asked for this
assigment after the exams, to then spend more time on it.

propbably used too much time on the *DummyData.json* and some prop-errorhandling and
may should have used time one the actual functionality and styles first, to reach the deadline.

## DEMO:

1. Clone the project
2. Navigate to the root folder and run: **npm i** in the cmdpromt
3. Run: **npm start**
